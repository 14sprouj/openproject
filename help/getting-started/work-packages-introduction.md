# Introduction to Work Packages

Work packages are issues (such as tasks, risks, ideas, user stories)  used to track a project’s progress. These work package types can be [activated by a project administrator](./project-admin-guide/#activate-work-package-types) according to the specific project requirements . Therefore, work package types may differ across projects.

Work packages capture important project information. They can be [assigned to a project member](https://www.openproject.org/help/work-packages/edit-update-work-package/) and be displayed in a [timeline](https://www.openproject.org/help/timelines/). In addition, [work package hierarchies](https://www.openproject.org/help/work-packages/work-package-hierarchies/) provide an easy-to-understand overview of a project’s structure and progress.

## What is a Work Package?

A Work Package is a subset of a project that can be assigned to users for execution, such as Tasks, Bugs, User Stories, Milestones, and more. Work packages have a **type**, an **ID**, a **subject** and a **status** and may have various additional attributes, such as assignee, priority, due date. Work packages can be displayed in a projects timeline, e.g. as a milestone or a phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.
