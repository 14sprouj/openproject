## What is the project overview?

The project overview is a single dashboard page where all important project information can be displayed to have it centrally available for the project team.

You can add project information as widgets to the dashboard and order and re-size the widgets to your need.

Also, you can add text widgets, to add custom texts, links and other information to your overview page.
