3. Upload additional **files** to your budgets with drag and drop or by clicking on the field and choosing a file from the explorer.
4. Enter a **fixed date** if needed, this date will be taken for the budget to calculate the planned costs based on the [configured hourly rate](../time-and-costs/cost-tracking) in the user's profile. The hourly rate can be set for different date rages, therefore, if you set a fixed date for a budget, always the rate from this date will be taken.
