# Backlogs (Scrum)

Working in agile project teams is becoming increasingly important.

OpenProject supports your work with the Scrum methodology by providing a variety of functionalities. You can record and prioritize user stories in the sprint and product backlog, use digital task boards or burndown-charts, print story cards, and much more. For more information, please refer to the OpenProject [agile and scrum features](https://www.openproject.org/collaboration-software-features/agile-scrum-agile-project-management-openproject/) page.

Please note that this user guide does not represent an introduction into scrum methodology, but merely explains the scrum-related functionalities and user instructions in OpenProject.
