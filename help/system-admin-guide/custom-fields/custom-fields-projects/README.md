# Display custom fields in the project list

As a user of the OpenProject Enterprise Edition you can customize the work package list and show additional project information by adding  custom fields to the project list.
 With this option you can for example display a project’s status, responsible or progress.

In order to display custom fields in the project list, first make sure that you have an [activated Enterprise Edition](https://www.openproject.org/activate-the-enterprise-edition/) or use the Cloud Edition.

## Creating a project custom field

Next, as an OpenProject admin navigate to the administration to  create a new custom field. To do this, click on your user name in the  upper right corner (1), select *Administration* from the dropdown menu (2) and select *Custom fields* from the side menu (3).
 Select the tab *Projects* (4) and click on the link *Create a new custom field* (5) to create a project custom field.

In the newly opened create form provide a name to display in the project list (e.g. Project status) (6), a format (e.g. List) (7) and enter the values which can be selected (8).
 Optionally, define if the custom field should be required and searchable (9).
 Click *Save* to create the custom field.

## Setting and displaying a project custom field

Once you created the custom field you can set it in a project’s settings.
 To do this navigate to a project and select *Project settings* from the side menu (1). The project custom field is visible in the pre-selected *Information* tab. As a project manager you can set the project custom field to communicate the status (2).

Next, navigate to the project list by selecting *View all projects* from the project selection menu in the top left side.

You will see the project custom field displayed as a column in the  project list. Therefore, you can easily communicate project information  across multiple projects.
