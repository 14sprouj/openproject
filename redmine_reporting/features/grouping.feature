Feature: Groups

  @javascript
  Scenario: We got some awesome default settings
    Given there is a standard cost control project named "First Project"
    And I am logged in as "controller"
    And I am on the Cost Reports page for the project called "First Project"
    Then I should see "Week (Spent)" within "select[@id='group_by_columns']"
    And I should see "Issue" within "select[@id='group_by_rows']"

  @javascript
  Scenario: A click on clear removes all groups
    Given there is a standard cost control project named "First Project"
    And I am logged in as "controller"
    And I am on the Cost Reports page for the project called "First Project"
    And I click on "Clear"
    Then I should not see "Week (Spent)" within "select[@id='group_by_columns']"
    And I should not see "Issue" within "select[@id='group_by_rows']"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Groups can be added to either rows or columns
    Given there is a standard cost control project named "First Project"
    And I am logged in as "controller"
    And I am on the Cost Reports page for the project called "First Project"
    And I click on "Clear"
    And I group columns by "Issue"
    Then I should see "Issue" within "select[@id='group_by_columns']"
    And I should not see "Issues" within "select[@id='group_by_container']"
    When I group rows by "Project"
    Then I should see "Project" within "select[@id='group_by_rows']"
    And I should not see "Project" within "select[@id='group_by_container']"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Groups get restored after sending a query
