# Integrations

If you have previously worked with other tools and want to transfer projects to OpenProject, there is a way to do so. 

**Jira**

You can export your tasks into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an Excel plugin into OpenProject:  https://www.openproject.org/de/synchronize-excel-openproject/

**Microsoft Project**

For Microsoft Project it works the same way as for Jira. You are using the Excel plugin to import your tasks.  https://www.openproject.org/de/synchronize-excel-openproject/

**Gitlab**

There is not yet an integration of Gitlab in OpenProject yet. However, there is some development going on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21933#note_309977508 and we have from our side also prioritised this task and are working on it.
