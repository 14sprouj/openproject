The _OpenProject Revit Add-In_ allows you to use the open source project management software _OpenProject BIM_ directly within your Revit environment. It lets you create, inspect and manage issues right in the moment when you can also solve them - when you have your Revit application fired up and the relevant BIM models open. Issues get stored as BCFs centrally and are available to every team member in real time - thanks to our browser based IFC viewer even to those team members without expensive Revit licenses. No BCF XML import/export is needed. However, you still can import and export BCF XML as you like and stay interoparable with any other BCF software.The _OpenProject Revit Add-In_ is released under the Open Source license GPL V3.

For example, `http://**your-organization-name**.openproject.com` if you are using our SAAS edition. If you are using our Enterprise or Community edition, please ask your OpenProject admin for the correct URL.

If you don&#39;t have an _OpenProject BIM_ instance already, you can get one hosted in our cloud in just a few clicks. Please click on the &quot;Don&#39;t you have an account yet? Get one here&quot; link. On the OpenProject site, please introduce the name of your organization and follow the registration steps. Once the registration is done, please come back to the _OpenProject BIM Revit Add-In_ and introduce the URL of your OP instance, just as indicated above in step 2.
