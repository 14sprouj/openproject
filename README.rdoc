= ChiliProject Backlogs Plugin

This Plugin adds features, that enable agile teams to work efficiently with
ChiliProject in Scrum projects.

It is largely based on {Redmine Backlogs}[http://www.redminebacklogs.net/].
Development was separated from Redmine Backlogs in March 2011. At this time
Redmine Backlogs v0.3.2 was current. ChiliProject Backlogs is more than just a
port from Redmine to ChiliProject.


== Requirements

This plugin depends on the {ChiliProject NIssue
Plugin}[https://github.com/finnlabs/chiliproject_nissue]. Make sure, to have a
current version of that Plugin installed into your ChiliProject.

This plugin requires some additional RubyGems. After you have extracted the
plugin into `vendor/plugins`, make sure to run `bundle install` to install these
additional dependencies.

project's issue tracker.
