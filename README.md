# OpenProject Github Integration Plugin

**Warning**: This is work in progress.

`openproject-github_integration` is an OpenProject plugin, which aims to integrate github code repositories
and a pull request workflow with OpenProject.

##Features:

* OpenProject can be linked to a/multiple github repository/repositories
* WorkPackages can be (automagically) linked to Pull Requests
* Commits can link to work packages ("this commit is related to #1234")

OpenProject is supported by its community members, both companies as well as individuals. There are different possibilities of getting help:

## Start Collaborating

Join the OpenProject community and start collaborating. We envision building a platform to share ideas, contributions, and discussions around OpenProject and project collaboration. Each commitment is noteworthy as it helps to improve the software and the project.
